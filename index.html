          <h3>Overall improved fitness</h3>
          <p class="info-content-paragraph">
            One of the major benefits of trekking is that it improves your
            physical health immensely. Spending multiple hours on the trail,
            climbing around boulders, rock hopping and ascending hills gives
            your whole body a workout, improving your strength, agility and
            cardio fitness. It’s also a fantastic way to lose weight, in that if
            you carry a full pack, you can burn around 600 calories per hour
            while trekking
          </p>
          <h3>Reduces Stress</h3>
          <p class="info-content-paragraph">
            It’s hard to argue with science. A study in the
            <a
              href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/06/23/1510459112"
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
              >The Proceedings of the National Acadamy of Science</a
            >
            found that that “ exposure to nature can counteract the negative
            effects of stress and anxiety: Those who completed the nature walk
            tended toward less rumination—the acute focus on one’s distress—than
            those who took the urban route”. Spending time outdoors on a trek or
            active holiday in nature is a perfect way to cleanse your mind from
            the stress and worries from home. Trekking often requires a person
            to be focussed on their activity, where the only distractions are
            majestic vistas and dramatic scenery. Ask any trekker and they’ll
            attest that spending time in the wilderness was one of the most
            relaxing times they’ve had.

          <h3>Improves Cardiovascular strength</h3>
          <p class="info-content-paragraph">
            Regular trekking can increase cardiovascular strength as the heart
            has to pump harder to keep up with the oxygen demand while trekking.
            This increases blood flow to the muscles and the brain, improving
            the circulatory and respiratory system’s health. In addition,
            breathing in the fresh air and pure oxygen from the forest and trees
            keeps the respiratory system clean – a refreshing change from the
            city air, where
